To test this project you need to :
- compile the files with make command
- run the program with ./bsq file.txt where file.txt will be your file
- the file.txt should only contain 'o' and 'x' characters

To see the output of the program clearly :
- when your compile do this ./bsq file.txt > output.txt

To remove all the .o files you can :
- do the command make clean
- do the command make fclean (this command will also remove the binary ./bsq)

To recompile the program you can :
- do the command make re
